**What It Does**

GetYoMoneyUp detects when a user enters an online checkout or shopping cart page and then pops up a message to remind them to consider their financial decisions. The popup displays a series of warnings and prompts the user to reflect on their spending habits. It also includes a "Save for Later" feature that allows users to store the link to a product and return to it laterâ€”so they have time to decide if the purchase is truly necessary. Our intention is not to shame users for buying, but to discourage impulsivity and encourage responsible purchase.

**How to Use:**
1. Download GetYoMoneyUp repo to local computer.
2. Go to the Extensions page by entering chrome://extensions in a new tab. (By design chrome:// URLs are not linkable.)
   Alternatively, click the Extensions menu puzzle button and select Manage Extensions at the bottom of the menu.
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
4. Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.
